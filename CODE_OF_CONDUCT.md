# CODE OF CONDUCT

We adopt the [Inner Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) following principles:

- Transparency: All discussions, reviews, and design decisions happen in the open via GitHub PRs and Issues;
- Autonomy: You can contribute directly without waiting for “permission,” as long as you follow the rules;
- Quality Gates: Automated builds and tests ensure changes are safe;
- Documentation First: Every new feature or change must be documented before merge.

We also draw inspiration from the [Scrum Values](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-values) as a guide:

- **Courage**: courage to do the right thing and face tough problems, exhibiting courage to explore the unknown, to change direction, to share information and to engage in courteous disagreements;
- **Focus**: focus on creating value and what’s currently most important to be done;
- **Commitment**: commitment and dedication to delivering value and quality;
- **Respect**: respect each other as skilled professionals, respecting each other's differing expertise and perspectives, always being respectful when they disagree;
- **Openness**: be open about all of the work and the challenges with performing the work, sharing feedback and learn from each other.
