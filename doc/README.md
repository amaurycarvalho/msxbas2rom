# Project Documentation Assets

## Purpose

`doc/` stores project reference documents such as architecture notes, process material, hardware/test-machine notes, and technical references.

## Scope

- Long-form documents (`.pdf`, `.odp`, `.txt`) used as historical and technical reference;
- Supporting documentation not intended to be part of source compilation.

## Usage

- Consult these files for project context and legacy technical decisions;
- Search for normative/active engineering rules in `specs/` (`constitution.md`, ADRs, tasks, user stories).

## Wiki

- Prefer to search for help at the project [wiki](https://github.com/amaurycarvalho/msxbas2rom/wiki).
