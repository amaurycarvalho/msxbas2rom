# Tasks – Current Sprint Backlog

## To do list

- [x] Write user stories in separate files at user-stories/ for lexer (src/lex.cpp), parser (src/parse.cpp), compiler (src/compiler.cpp), builder (rom.cpp and resources.cpp) and cli (src/main.cpp) writing test scenarios for each one (see ADR-001);
- [x] Optimize the project Makefile to consider src/ and include/ dependencies;
- [x] Rename test/ to tests/, adjusting the related .github/workflows/test.yml and .vscode/tasks.json (and any other reference on any file to the old folder) according the changes;
- [x] Write unit tests on tests/unit/ for lexer, parser, compiler and builder refactoring test.cpp and test_resources, adjusting the related Makefile and .github/workflows/test.yml according the changes;
- [x] Move all .cpp and .h files from src/ and include/ to src/cli/, src/application/, src/domain/ and src/infrastructure/ according by each file code objective (dont delete any file or modify its contents in this step, ask me if any doubt). Next, adjust the related Makefile, asm/Makefile and unit testings (tests/) according the changes. Finally, delete include/ folder if empty;
- [x] At src/application/lexer, rename lex.cpp to lexer.cpp and lex.h to lexer.h. Next, at src/application/parser, rename parse.cpp to parser.cpp and parse.h to parser.h. Finally, adjust the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [x] Create tests/unit/src/ folder. Next, move tests/unit/\*.cpp files to tests/unit/src/. Finally, adjust the related Makefile according the changes;
- [x] Refactor src/domain/symbols/ files to one file per class practice (do not change any code), adjusting the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [x] Move src/domain/symbols/symbol_manager.\* to src/application/symbols/. Next, refactor it implementing a Strategy pattern (tell me if another pattern applies better) with minimum code change. The individual strategy files must be saved to src/application/symbols/strategies/ folder. Finally, adjust the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [x] Move asm/ folder to src/infrastructure/kernel/asm/, adjusting the related Makefile and .vscode/tasks.json according the changes. Finally, check for more related dependencies;
- [x] Refactor src/application/lexer/ files to one file per class practice (do not change any code), adjusting the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [x] Refactor src/application/lexer/lexer_line implementing a State pattern instanciated by a factory with minimum code change. The individual states files must be saved to src/application/lexer/states/ folder. Finally, adjust the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [x] Refactor src/application/parser/ files to one file per class practice (do not change any code), adjusting the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [x] Refactor src/application/parser/ implementing a Strategy pattern instanciated by a factory with minimum code change. The individual strategy files must be saved to src/application/parser/strategies/ folder. Finally, adjust the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [ ] Refactor src/application/compiler/ files to one file per class practice (do not change any code), adjusting the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [ ] Refactor src/application/compiler/ implementing a Strategy pattern instanciated by a factory with minimum code change. The individual strategy files must be saved to src/application/compiler/strategies/ folder. Finally, adjust the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [ ] Refactor src/application/builder/ files to one file per class practice (do not change any code), adjusting the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [ ] Refactor src/application/builder/ implementing a Strategy pattern instanciated by a factory with minimum code change. The individual strategy files must be saved to src/application/builder/strategies/ folder. Finally, adjust the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [ ] Search the codebase src/ folder for any code access to the file system. Next, create a file system class adapter (interface) to be used by cli and application, with concrete class in infrastructure (see wrapper class in src/infrastructure/fs) respecting clean archictecture and paying attention to the file access pecularities used by each original code in the codebase. Next, refactor the codebase to use the new file system adapter and concrete class. Finally, adjust the related Makefile and unit testings according the changes;
- [ ] Propose a better exception handling pattern to the codebase (src/), create a plan and write tasks here to refactor it step by step.
